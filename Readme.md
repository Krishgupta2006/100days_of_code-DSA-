## 📖 Overview

This repository documents my *100 Days of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)* journey. The goal is to master the fundamentals of DSA using the *C programming language* by solving one problem every single day.

The problems are sourced from the [*100 Days of DSA*](https://100-days-of-dsa.vercel.app/) platform provided by my college.

## 🎯 Goals

- 🧠 *Build Logic:* Strengthen problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.
- 💻 *Master C:* Gain deep control over memory management, pointers, and manual data structure implementation.
- 🔥 *Consistency:* Maintain a 100-day coding streak.
- 📊 *Interview Prep:* Prepare for technical interviews by mastering standard algorithms.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- *Language:* C (GCC Compiler)
- *IDE:* VS Code
- *Topics:* Data Structures, Algorithms, Time & Space Complexity ($O(n)$, $O(\log n)$, etc.)

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by day. Each folder contains the problem statement, the solution code, and a brief explanation.
